From the analysis, it will help us in deciding how many bikes we will need to start operation in in new location, will help us increase the number of subscribers and retain existing customer and enhance thier experiences. Also, it is clear that promotions need to done to entice female riders.

I would recommed creating UserID for the customers do an analysis on the frequency of bike rides taken by customer. Also, survey on the customers experience would be helpful to expand geographically and choose location by deciding if the model could be replicated in college town targeting students. Also analyzing the price would be helpful for forecating revnue and make pricing decisions.
